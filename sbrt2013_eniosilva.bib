  journal = {IEEE Commun. Mag.},
  year = {May 2006},
  volume = {44, no. 5},
  pages = {106-111},
  abstract = {The restricted audio quality of today’s telephone networks is mainly
	due to the narrowband (NB) limitation to the frequency range from
	
	
	about 300 Hz to 3.4 kHz. Meanwhile, codecs for wideband (WB) telephony
	(50 Hz to 7 kHz) exist with significantly improved speech intelligibility
	and naturalness. However, the broad introduction of wideband speech
	coding will require strong efforts of both network operators and
	their customers because many elements of the
	
	
	networks (i.e., terminals and network nodes) have to be modified.
	An intermediate step to overcome the narrowband limitation can be
	
	
	achieved by applying artificial bandwidth extension (BWE) in the receiver.
	In this article we review the basic principles of bandwidth extension,
	and discuss several application scenarios in which both wideband
	coding and BWE complement each other. The introduction of BWE methods
	in terminals and networks may help to speed up the introduction of
	true wideband speech coding in the near future.},

	with “standard telephone” quality into wideband speech. A statistical
	approach based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) is used, which takes
	into account several features of the band-limited speech. The narrowband
	input signal is classified into a limited number of speech sounds
	(HMM states) for which the wideband spectral envelope is estimated
	using the pre-trained model. The enhanced speech exhibits a significantly
	improved quality without objectionable artifacts.},

	IP (VoIP) applications. G.729.1 can operate at 12 different bit rates
	from 32 down to 8 kbit/s with wideband quality starting at 14 kbit/s.
	This coder is a bitstream interoperable extension of ITU-T G.729
	based on three embedded stages: narrowband cascaded CELP coding at
	8 and 12 kbit/s, time-domain bandwidth extension (TDBWE) at 14 kbit/s,
	and split-band MDCT coding with spherical vector quantization (VQ)
	and pre-echo reduction from 16 to 32 kbit/s. Side information - consisting
	of signal class, phase, and energy - is transmitted at 12, 14 and
	16 kbit/s to improve the resilience and recovery of the decoder in
	case of frame erasures. The quality, delay, and complexity of G.729.1
	are summarized based on ITU-T results},
